<h2>Tumblr Bot</h2>

TumblrBot is ruby/watir-driven tumblr bot which emulates a human by navigating to relevant tag sets and 
reblogging posts at random, adding sudo-relevant tags from the reblogged post. In addition, it automatically refollows
users if they're currently following the blog.

An example of TumblrBot in action can be found @ http://sciencethangs.tumblr.com
